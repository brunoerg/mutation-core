# Mutation Core

**A mutation testing tool for Bitcoin Core**. 

"Mutation testing (or mutation analysis or program mutation) is used to design new software tests and evaluate the quality of existing software tests. Mutation testing involves modifying a program in small ways.[1] Each mutated version is called a mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing the behaviour of the original version to differ from the mutant. This is called killing the mutant. Test suites are measured by the percentage of mutants that they kill." (Wikipedia)

## Features

- Allows generating mutants only for the code touched or added in a specific branch (useful to test PRs) and avoid spending time by generating mutants for files from bench/test/doc/etc folders.
- Allows generating mutants using only some security-based mutation operators. This might be good for testing fuzzing.

- Avoids creating useless mutants. (e.g. by skipping comments, `LogPrintf` statements...).
- Allows generating only one mutant per line of code (might be useful for CI/CD).
- Allows creating mutants for the functional and unit tests.
- Allows to create mutants only for code that is covered by tests.

...and, of course, there are some specific mutation operators designed for Bitcoin Core.

## How to use (simplest way)

```sh
cd bitcoin
git checkout branch # if needed - it can be your local working branch or some PR branch
./mutation-core mutate
./mutation-core analyze
```

## How to use

Generate mutants for a specific file:
```sh
./mutation-core mutate -f=path/to/file
```

Generate mutants for a specific PR (it will only create mutants for the touched code. You should run it into Bitcoin Core folder):
```sh
./mutation-core mutate -p=PR_NUMBER
```

Create only one mutant per line (if you want faster analysis):
```sh
./mutation-core mutate -p=PR_NUMBER --one_mutant=1
```

If you want to create mutants only for unit or functional tests touched by a PR:
```sh
./mutation-core mutate -p=PR_NUMBER --test_only=1
```

If you do not specify either a file or PR number, it will create mutants for the touched code by the current branch you are checked out. If the specified file is a Python one, it will create mutants considering it is a functional test.

You can specify a test coverage file (i.e. *.info) to create mutants only for code that is covered by tests.
```sh
./mutation-core mutate -f=path/to/file -c=path/to/total_coverage.info
```

The `mutate` command will create folders with mutants (one folder per mutated file). To test them you can run:

```sh
./mutation-core analyze -f=path/to/folder -c="command to test each mutant"
```
e.g.
```sh
./mutation-core analyze -f=path/to/folder -c="cmake --build build && ./build/test/functional/foo123.py"
```

Or simply...
```sh
./mutation-core analyze
```

By not specifying the command, the tool will test every mutant by running all the unit and functional tests. In case the mutated file is a test one, it will simply run that specific test.

## Mutating unit and functional tests

Does it make sense? Yes! See: https://github.com/trailofbits/necessist/blob/master/docs/Necessist%20Mutation%202024.pdf

By removing some statements and method calls, we can check whether the test passes and identify buggy tests. In our case, we 
will not touch any `wait_for`, `wait_until`, `send_and_ping`, `assert_*`, `BOOST_*` and other verifications.

See an example of the usage of this tool for `test/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py`.

```bash
./mutation-core mutate -f="./test/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py"
```
```bash
./mutation-core analyze -f="muts" -c="./test/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py"
```
